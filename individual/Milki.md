# Lessons Summary

## Lesson 1: Programming for a Purpose

Question of the day: How can we design animations and games based on the needs of a user? Refer to your activity guide to recommend templates to clients.
        Answer
        - Target Audience: Identify the age group, interests, and preferences.
                        Example: Educational games for children vs. immersive animations for gamers.
        Purpose: Is it for entertainment, education, marketing, or training?
                        Example: A business might need a branded game or explainer animation.
        Platform: Determine where the game/animation will be used (e.g., mobile, web, VR).


## Lesson 2: Plotting Shapes

Question of the Day: How can we clearly communicate how to draw something on a screen?
-    Use grids, axes, or dotted lines to help users place elements accurately.
-   Drew shapes on the Game Lab's grid per the instructions.

## Lesson 3: Drawing in Game Lab

Question of the Day: How can we communicate to a computer how to draw shapes on the screen?

-   Predicted the output of a shape coded in the game lab.
            My Prediction is that the rectancle is starts from top 100 and left 100
-   Explore Game Lab
        -Do This.
           Change the numbers inside the block, then try running the program again.
        Try to place the rectangle near the bottom right of the screen.  
 # Answer
    `rect(350,350);`

- Place two rectangles exactly in the corners of the screen, just like the picture.
    You will need to drag out a second rect() block!.
# Answer
    `rect(350,350);`
-Place two rectangles exactly in the corners of the screen, just like the picture.
        You will need to drag out a second rect() block!
   # Answer
    `rect(0,0);`
    `rect(350,350);`
 1) Change the color from blue to yellow.
    `fill("yellow");`
   ` rect(100,100);`
    `rect(250, 100);`
 2) Add a new square to the image
    `rect(200, 200);`
    `rect(300, 400);`
    `rect(100, 350);`

- Order Matters
In Game Lab, it matters what order your code is in. New shapes are drawn on top of the ones that came before, covering up the shapes that are drawn first. You can see the difference when you use more than one color in your code.

Do This
1) Look at the code that draws the two rectangles.
  The first is drawn red, and the second is drawn blue.
2) Change the red rectangle's color to green.
3) the order of the code so the green rectangle appears on top.
Remember you can always turn on the grid (Show Me Where) or hover with the mouse to help find the x and y position you want.
# Answer 

 `fill("blue");`
 `rect(175,175);`
 `fill("green");`
 `rect(200, 200);`

 ellipse
You can use ellipse() to make a circle.

Do This
1) Look at the code that makes the ellipse.
2) Add a new ellipse of a different color.
        Remember you can always turn on the grid (Show Me Where) or hover with the mouse to help find the x and y position you want.
# Answer
`fill(rgb(23,45,122));`
`ellipse(200, 300);`
