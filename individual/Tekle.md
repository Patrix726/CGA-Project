## Lesssons Summary 
###   Lesson One : Programming for a purpose

- Question of the Day : How can we design animations and games based on the needs of users   

  ### Animations and Game Design Templates

 - One of activity guide to recommend of templates to each client based on their needs
    
    - To design animations and games based on user needs
          - Conduct User Research
          - Define Objectives
          - Create Personas
          - Develop Prototypes
          - Ensure Accessibility
          - Iterate Based on Feedback
### Lesson Two : Plotting Shapes
 ### Question of the Day: How can we clearly communicate how to draw something on a screen? #
  - In this lesson, you will explore the challenges of communicating clear instructions using a Game 
       Lab tool to draw shapes on the Game Lab's grid! 
### Lesson Three : Drawing in Game Lab
 **Question of the Day:** How can we communicate to a computer how to draw shapes on the screen?
   - In this lesson, you will begin to use Game Lab to position shapes on the screen while working through the concepts of sequencing and debugging
- **Introduced Code**
   - ellipse(x, y, w, h)
   - fill(color)
   - rect(x, y, w, h)
- **Level One  :Introduction to Game Lab**
      `rect(100,100)`
      when it is run we view rectangle
- **Level Two - Six : Sklii Building**

   - Level Two :
      `rect(350,350,50,50);`
   - Level Three :
      `rect(350,350,50,50);`
      `rect(300,350,50,50);`
   -  Level Four :
      `fill("yellow");`
      `rect(100,100,50,50);`
      `rect(250,100,50,50);`
      `rect(100,200,50,50);`
   - Level Five :
      `fill("blue");`
      `rect(200,200);`
      `fill("green");`
      `rect(175, 175);`
   - Level Six :
      `fill("blue");`
      `ellipse(100,100);`
      `fill("yellow");`
      `ellipse(200, 200);`


- **Level Seven  :Practice**
   Choose from the following activities:
     I choose D that is "Draw a Car"

     `fill("blue");`
     `rect(150, 150);`
     `rect(200, 150);`
     `fill("green");`
     `rect(100, 200);`
     `rect(150, 200);`
     `rect(200, 200);`
     `rect(250, 200);`
     `fill("red");`
     `ellipse(150, 250);`
     `ellipse(250, 250);`

- **Level Eight  :Assessment**
      `fill("orange");`
      `ellipse(150,150);`
      `ellipse(200,150);`
      `ellipse(150,200);`
      `ellipse(200,200);`
      `fill("purple");`
      `rect(150, 150);`

- **Level Nine  :Challenges**
  Choose from the following activities:

   `I choose D "Face"`
   `fill(rgb(66, 245, 230));`
   `ellipse(150, 100);`
   `ellipse(250, 100);`
   `fill("red");`
   `ellipse(200, 200);`
   `fill(rgb(66, 245, 135));`
   `rect(100, 250);`
   `rect(150, 275);`
   `rect(200, 275);`
   `rect(250, 250);`
### Lesson Four : Shapes and Parameters
  **Question of the Day:** How can we use parameters to give the computer more specific instructions?

   - In this lesson, you will continue working in Game Lab and increasing your familiarity with drawing shapes to the screen by manipulating the "parameters" of the shapes you are using to draw.
