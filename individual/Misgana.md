#### **Lesson One: Programming for a Purpose**  
**Question of the Day:**  
*How can we design animations and games that cater to the needs of users?*  

**Key Focus:**  
Use your activity guide to recommend suitable templates to clients.  

**Template Types:**  

1. **Welcome Screen**  
   - Introduces the app or project with a friendly message and instructions.  
   - Includes a start or continue button to set the tone and purpose.  

2. **User Input Screen**  
   - Collects user inputs using text fields, buttons, or interactive elements.  
   - Customizes the app experience based on user data.  

3. **Information Screen**  
   - Displays static content, instructions, or facts for user reference.  
   - Adds context with text and images.  

4. **Feedback Screen**  
   - Provides responses based on user actions, such as quiz results, "Thank You" notes, or summaries.  

5. **End/Exit Screen**  
   - Marks the conclusion with gratitude messages.  
   - Offers options to restart or exit the app.  

**Task:**  
Complete the survey provided.

#### **Lesson Two: Plotting Shapes**  
**Question of the Day:**  
*How can we effectively communicate instructions for drawing shapes on a screen?*  

**Key Focus:**  
Learn to use the **Drawing Shapes Template** for visual elements.  

**Steps to Draw Shapes:**  
1. Choose a color for the shape.  
2. Click on a shape to add it to the canvas.  
3. Experiment with different options to create designs.

#### **Lesson Three: Shapes and Coordinates**  
**Question of the Day:**  
*How can coordinates help us position and size shapes on a canvas?*  

**Key Concepts:**  

1. **Canvas and Grid:**  
   - The canvas uses a 2D coordinate system starting at (0, 0) in the top-left.  
   - The x-axis extends to the right, and the y-axis extends downward.  

2. **`rect()` Function:**  
   - `rect(x, y)` places a rectangle at the top-left corner (x, y).  
   - Additional parameters specify the width and height.  

3. **Predicting Placement:**  
   - Experiment with (x, y) values to understand shape positioning.  
   - Default dimensions are applied if width and height are not specified (e.g., 50x50 pixels).  

**Activities:**  
- Draw shapes using different coordinates.  
- Change parameters to observe effects on placement and size.  
- Collaborate with peers to predict shape positions through code analysis.

**Lesson 4: Parameters in Functions**  
*Question of the Day:* How do parameters make functions more adaptable?  
**Key Concepts:**  
- Parameters enable functions to take inputs and generate varied outputs.  
- They are crucial for creating flexible and reusable code.  
**Activities:**  
- Writing functions with parameters to adjust behaviors.  
- Examples include modifying colors or sizes based on input values.  

**Lesson 5: Variables**  
*Question of the Day:* How do variables help manage data in programs?  
**Key Concepts:**  
- Variables store information that can change as the program runs.  
- They are used for tasks such as tracking scores, user inputs, or program settings.  
**Activities:**  
- Creating and updating variables in animations and games.  
- Using variables for interactivity, such as event counting.
