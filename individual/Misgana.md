#### **Lesson Three: Shapes and Coordinates**  
**Question of the Day:**  
*How can coordinates help us position and size shapes on a canvas?*

   - The canvas uses a 2D coordinate system starting at (0, 0) in the top-left.  
   - The x-axis extends to the right, and the y-axis extends downward.  

2. **`rect()` Function:**  
   - `rect(x, y)` places a rectangle at the top-left corner (x, y).  
   - Additional parameters specify the width and height.  

3. **Predicting Placement:**  
   - Experiment with (x, y) values to understand shape positioning.  
   - Default dimensions are applied if width and height are not specified (e.g., 50x50 pixels).  

**Activities:**  
- Draw shapes using different coordinates.  
- Change parameters to observe effects on placement and size.  
- Collaborate with peers to predict shape positions through code analysis.
