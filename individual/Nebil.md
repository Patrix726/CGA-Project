## Lesson 1: Programming for a Purpose

Question of the day: How can we design animations and games based on the needs of a user? Refer to your activity guide to recommend templates to clients.

-   Checked out the activity guide
-   Answer to templates for clients
    -   Maria - Template A (Since the aliens are fun and cute and the text block can be used to show a dialogue for reading.)
    -   Richard - Template B (Since we can change the junk food with trash and healthy food with plastics to teach recycling)
    -   Layla - Template E (Since it is a nice greeting card format with fun interactions with the characters)
    -   Emma - Template D (Since we can change the rabbit with a shark and carrots with fish and bugs with people to teach kids about sharks)
    -   Levi - Template C (Since there are already characters interacting with their surroundings)
-   Completed the survey
