#### **Lesson One: Programming for a Purpose**  
**Question of the Day:**  
*How can we design animations and games that cater to the needs of users?*  

**Key Focus:**  
Use your activity guide to recommend suitable templates to clients.  

**Template Types:**  

1. **Welcome Screen**  
   - Introduces the app or project with a friendly message and instructions.  
   - Includes a start or continue button to set the tone and purpose.  

2. **User Input Screen**  
   - Collects user inputs using text fields, buttons, or interactive elements.  
   - Customizes the app experience based on user data.  

3. **Information Screen**  
   - Displays static content, instructions, or facts for user reference.  
   - Adds context with text and images.  

4. **Feedback Screen**  
   - Provides responses based on user actions, such as quiz results, "Thank You" notes, or summaries.  

5. **End/Exit Screen**  
   - Marks the conclusion with gratitude messages.  
   - Offers options to restart or exit the app.  

**Task:**  
Complete the survey provided.

#### **Lesson Two: Plotting Shapes**  
**Question of the Day:**  
*How can we effectively communicate instructions for drawing shapes on a screen?*  

**Key Focus:**  
Learn to use the **Drawing Shapes Template** for visual elements.  

**Steps to Draw Shapes:**  
1. Choose a color for the shape.  
2. Click on a shape to add it to the canvas.  
3. Experiment with different options to create designs.

#### **Lesson Three: Shapes and Coordinates**  
**Question of the Day:**  
*How can coordinates help us position and size shapes on a canvas?*  

**Key Concepts:**  

1. **Canvas and Grid:**  
   - The canvas uses a 2D coordinate system starting at (0, 0) in the top-left.  
   - The x-axis extends to the right, and the y-axis extends downward.  

2. **`rect()` Function:**  
   - `rect(x, y)` places a rectangle at the top-left corner (x, y).  
   - Additional parameters specify the width and height.  

3. **Predicting Placement:**  
   - Experiment with (x, y) values to understand shape positioning.  
   - Default dimensions are applied if width and height are not specified (e.g., 50x50 pixels).  

**Activities:**  
- Draw shapes using different coordinates.  
- Change parameters to observe effects on placement and size.  
- Collaborate with peers to predict shape positions through code analysis.

**Lesson 4: Parameters in Functions**  
*Question of the Day:* How do parameters make functions more adaptable?  
**Key Concepts:**  
- Parameters enable functions to take inputs and generate varied outputs.  
- They are crucial for creating flexible and reusable code.  
**Activities:**  
- Writing functions with parameters to adjust behaviors.  
- Examples include modifying colors or sizes based on input values.  

**Lesson 5: Variables**  
*Question of the Day:* How do variables help manage data in programs?  
**Key Concepts:**  
- Variables store information that can change as the program runs.  
- They are used for tasks such as tracking scores, user inputs, or program settings.  
**Activities:**  
- Creating and updating variables in animations and games.  
- Using variables for interactivity, such as event counting.  

**Lesson 6: Random Numbers**  
*Question of the Day:* How do random numbers add dynamism to programs?  
**Key Concepts:**  
- Random numbers introduce variation and unpredictability.  
- They are useful for randomizing movements, creating challenges, or changing colors.  
**Activities:**  
- Generating random values within a range using `randomNumber(min, max)`.  
- Incorporating randomness in animations or interactive features.  

**Lesson 7: Mini-Project: Robot Face**  
*Question of the Day:* How can randomness enhance creative projects?  
**Key Concepts:**  
- Combines randomness with drawing shapes and positioning elements.  
- Allows for dynamic changes to a robot face design.  
**Activities:**  
- Designing a robot face with randomly changing features.  
- Using random numbers to adjust positions or sizes of elements.  

**Lesson 8: Sprites**  
*Question of the Day:* How are sprites used to represent objects in animations or games?  
**Key Concepts:**  
- Sprites are graphical elements that can move and interact in programs.  
- They simplify complex animations and improve visuals.  
**Activities:**  
- Creating and customizing sprites in Game Lab.  
- Integrating sprites into interactive projects.  

**Lesson 9: Sprite Properties**  
*Question of the Day:* How do sprite properties enhance animations?  
**Key Concepts:**  
- Sprites have attributes like position, size, and speed that can be modified.  
- Manipulating these properties allows for dynamic animations and interactivity.  
**Activities:**  
- Modifying sprite properties over time.  
- Exploring behaviors like bouncing or following paths.  

**Lesson 10: Testing and Debugging**  
*Question of the Day:* Why is testing essential, and how can it improve programs?  
**Key Concepts:**  
- Testing ensures programs work correctly and identifies issues.  
- Debugging involves finding and fixing errors for better functionality.  
**Activities:**  
- Testing programs with user interactions.  
- Refining code to enhance performance and user experience.
