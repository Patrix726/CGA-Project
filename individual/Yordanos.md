### Lesson One: Programming with Purpose  

**Daily Question:**  
How can we create animations and games that meet user needs effectively?  

**Main Focus:**  
Utilize the activity guide to suggest appropriate templates for clients.  

**Template Categories:**  

1. **Welcome Screen**  
   - Greets users with a friendly introduction and instructions.  
   - Features a "start" or "continue" button to establish the app's purpose and set the mood.  

2. **User Input Screen**  
   - Gathers user information through text fields, buttons, or interactive elements.  
   - Adapts the app experience based on provided user data.  

3. **Information Screen**  
   - Presents static details, instructions, or key facts for users to refer to.  
   - Enhances understanding by including text and visuals.  

4. **Feedback Screen**  
   - Responds to user actions, such as showing quiz outcomes, "Thank You" notes, or summaries.  

5. **End/Exit Screen**  
   - Concludes with a message of appreciation.  
   - Offers options to restart or close the app.  

**Task:**  
Complete the assigned survey.

### Lesson Two: Drawing Shapes  

**Daily Question:**  
How can we clearly explain the steps to draw shapes on a screen?  

**Main Focus:**  
Understand how to use the Drawing Shapes Template for creating visual designs.  

**Steps to Draw Shapes:**  
1. Pick a color for your shape.  
2. Click on a shape to place it on the canvas.  
3. Try different combinations to create unique designs.

### Lesson Three: Shapes and Coordinate Systems  

**Daily Question:**  
How can coordinates help us accurately position and size shapes on a canvas?  

**Key Ideas:**  

1. **Canvas and Grid System:**  
   - The canvas operates on a 2D grid with (0, 0) as the top-left corner.  
   - The x-axis extends to the right, and the y-axis extends downward.  

2. **`rect()` Function:**  
   - `rect(x, y)` places a rectangle at coordinates (x, y), starting at its top-left corner.  
   - Additional parameters define the rectangle’s width and height.  

3. **Predicting Placement:**  
   - Experiment with various (x, y) values to understand where shapes will appear.  
   - If dimensions aren’t specified, default sizes (e.g., 50x50 pixels) are applied.  

**Activities:**  
- Use different coordinates to draw shapes.  
- Adjust parameters to observe changes in placement and size.  
- Work with peers to analyze code and predict shape positions.
