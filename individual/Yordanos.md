### Lesson One: Programming with Purpose  

**Daily Question:**  
How can we create animations and games that meet user needs effectively?  

**Main Focus:**  
Utilize the activity guide to suggest appropriate templates for clients.  

**Template Categories:**  

1. **Welcome Screen**  
   - Greets users with a friendly introduction and instructions.  
   - Features a "start" or "continue" button to establish the app's purpose and set the mood.  

2. **User Input Screen**  
   - Gathers user information through text fields, buttons, or interactive elements.  
   - Adapts the app experience based on provided user data.  

3. **Information Screen**  
   - Presents static details, instructions, or key facts for users to refer to.  
   - Enhances understanding by including text and visuals.  

4. **Feedback Screen**  
   - Responds to user actions, such as showing quiz outcomes, "Thank You" notes, or summaries.  

5. **End/Exit Screen**  
   - Concludes with a message of appreciation.  
   - Offers options to restart or close the app.  

**Task:**  
Complete the assigned survey.

### Lesson Two: Drawing Shapes  

**Daily Question:**  
How can we clearly explain the steps to draw shapes on a screen?  

**Main Focus:**  
Understand how to use the Drawing Shapes Template for creating visual designs.  

**Steps to Draw Shapes:**  
1. Pick a color for your shape.  
2. Click on a shape to place it on the canvas.  
3. Try different combinations to create unique designs.

### Lesson Three: Shapes and Coordinate Systems  

**Daily Question:**  
How can coordinates help us accurately position and size shapes on a canvas?  

**Key Ideas:**  

1. **Canvas and Grid System:**  
   - The canvas operates on a 2D grid with (0, 0) as the top-left corner.  
   - The x-axis extends to the right, and the y-axis extends downward.  

2. **`rect()` Function:**  
   - `rect(x, y)` places a rectangle at coordinates (x, y), starting at its top-left corner.  
   - Additional parameters define the rectangle’s width and height.  

3. **Predicting Placement:**  
   - Experiment with various (x, y) values to understand where shapes will appear.  
   - If dimensions aren’t specified, default sizes (e.g., 50x50 pixels) are applied.  

**Activities:**  
- Use different coordinates to draw shapes.  
- Adjust parameters to observe changes in placement and size.  
- Work with peers to analyze code and predict shape positions.

## Lesson 4: Parameters in Functions

**Question:** How do parameters make functions adaptable?

### Key Ideas:
- Parameters allow functions to take inputs and create different outputs.
- They make code flexible and reusable.

### Activities:
- Write functions with parameters to change behaviors (e.g., colors, sizes).

---

## Lesson 5: Variables

**xPosition = 300**

### Key Ideas:
- By reading the code with one variable, I make a prediction about where the circle belongs.
- By reading the code with two variables, I make a prediction about where the circle belongs.
- I update the values of the two variables to change the circle's position.

### Rules for Naming Variables:
- Labels can't have spaces.
- Labels can't start with a number.
- Capitalization and spelling must be exactly the same.
- Variables store data that can change, like scores or settings.
- I use one variable many times in one code.

### Activities:
- Use variables in animations or games.
- Make programs interactive (e.g., count events).

---

## Lesson 6: Random Numbers

**x = randomNumber(min, max)**

### Key Ideas:
- Random numbers add variation and unpredictability.
- They’re great for random movements, challenges, or color changes.

### Activities:
- Generate random values within a range.
- Add randomness to animations or games.

---

## Lesson 7: Mini-Project: Robot Face

### Key Ideas:
- I create a robot face using variables with `randomNumber`, `regularPolygon`, `ellipse`, and `fill`.
- Use randomness to adjust shapes and positions for a dynamic design.

---

## Lesson 8: Sprites

### Steps to Create Sprites:
1. **Create a new sprite variable called `sprite1`:**
   - Drag out a `createSprite()` block and give it the variable name `sprite1`.
2. **Draw your sprites on the screen:**
   - Drag out a `drawSprites()` block.

### Key Ideas:
- Sprites are graphic elements that move and interact.
- They simplify complex animations.

### Activities:
- Create and customize sprites in Game Lab.
- Add sprites to interactive projects.

---

## Lesson 9: Sprite Properties

**Question:** How do sprite properties improve animations?

### Key Ideas:
- Sprites have attributes like position, size, and speed.
- Changing these makes animations dynamic and interactive.

### Activities:
- Modify sprite properties over time.
- Create behaviors like bouncing or path-following.
