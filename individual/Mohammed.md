## Lesson 1: Programming for a Purpose

Question of the day: How can we design animations and games based on the needs of a user? Refer to your activity guide to recommend templates to clients.

-   Checked out the activity guide
-   Based on the Activity guide I  :
         - completed the word puzzle and tried to find words. 
         - tried to check the animation and game design template but I didn't get the point.
         - 
-   Completed the survey

## Lesson 2: Plotting Shapes
Question of the Day: How can we clearly communicate how to draw something on a screen?

-   After this lesson I was:
         - able to understand ho to instruct the game lab to display on the screen.
         - able to drag and drop shapes on the screen.

## Lesson 3: Drawing In Game Lab
Question of the Day: How can we communicate to a computer how to draw shapes on the screen?

-   After this lesson I was:
         - able to understand how to draw polygon shapes using functions like rect() and ellipse().
         - able to fill the shapes with different color on the screen.
## Lesson 4: Shapes and Parameters
Question of the Day: How can we use parameters to give the computer more specific instructions?

  After this lesson I was:
         - able to understand specific parameters that used to specifically design a shape.
         - able to undersatnd the polygon() function that can be used to draw a polygon of any shape.


## Lesson 5: Variables
Question of the Day: How do variables help manage data in programs?
 
 After this lesson I understood that:

        - Variables store information that can change as the program runs.
        - They are used for tasks such as tracking scores, user inputs, or program settings.
 Activities:
        - Creating and updating variables in animations and games.
        - Using variables for interactivity, such as event counting.
## Lesson 6: Random Numbers
 Question of the Day: How do random numbers add dynamism to programs?
 
 After this lesson I understood that:

       - Random numbers introduce variation and unpredictability.
       - They are useful for randomizing movements, creating challenges, or changing colors.
 Activities:
       - Generating random values within a range using randomNumber(min, max).
       - Incorporating randomness in animations or interactive features.
 ## Lesson 7: Mini-Project: Robot Face
 Question of the Day: How can randomness enhance creative projects?
 
 After this lesson I understood that randomness:

       - Combines randomness with drawing shapes and positioning elements.
       - Allows for dynamic changes to a robot face design.
 Activities:
       - Designing a robot face with randomly changing features.
       - Using random numbers to adjust positions or sizes of elements.

## Lesson 8: Sprites
 Question of the Day: How are sprites used to represent objects in animations or games?
 
 After this lesson I understood that :

       - Sprites are graphical elements that can move and interact in programs.
       - They simplify complex animations and improve visuals.
 Activities:
       - Creating and customizing sprites in Game Lab.
       - Integrating sprites into interactive projects.

## Lesson 9: Sprite Properties
Question of the Day: How do sprite properties enhance animations?
 
 After this lesson I understood that :

       - Sprites have attributes like position, size, and speed that can be modified.
       - Manipulating these properties allows for dynamic animations and interactivity.
 Activities:
       - Modifying sprite properties over time.
       - Exploring behaviors like bouncing or following paths.

## Lesson 10: Testing and Debugging
Question of the Day: Why is testing essential, and how can it improve programs?
 
 After this lesson I understood that :

       - Testing ensures programs work correctly and identifies issues.
       - Debugging involves finding and fixing errors for better functionality.
 Activities:
       - Testing programs with user interactions.
       - Refining code to enhance performance and user experience.

## Lesson 16: Keyboard Input

Question of the Day: How can our programs react to user input?

After this lesson I understood that:
   - The keyDown() block allows interaction through keyboard input.
   - Responding to user input makes programs more dynamic and engaging.
   - 
Activities: 
   - Prediction: Consider how keyboard input can enhance program interactivity.
   - Skill Building: Learn to use the keyDown() block to respond to user actions. 
   - Practice: Create programs that respond to various key inputs.
   - Assessment: Demonstrate understanding by creating an interactive program utilizing keyboard input.
   - Challenges: Explore creative and advanced applications of keyboard interactivity.
