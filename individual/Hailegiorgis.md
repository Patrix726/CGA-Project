    **User Input Screen:** This template focuses on capturing user input, such as text fields or buttons that allow users to enter their name, select options, or answer questions. This input is often used to personalize the app experience.

    **Feedback Screen:** This template is designed to give users feedback based on their input or actions within the app. It might display a "Thank You" message, show correct/incorrect answers in a quiz, or provide a summary of what the user has accomplished.
    
    **End/Exit Screen:** This template serves as the final screen of the app, often thanking the user for participating and providing options to restart the experience or exit the app.
