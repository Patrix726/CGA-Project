## **Lessons Summary**

## **Lesson One - Programming for a Purpose**

Question of the day: How can we design animations and games based on the needs of a user? Refer to your activity guide to recommend templates to clients.
- Checking out for the Templete
- On those Templete: 

  **Welcome Screen:** This template introduces users to the app or project. It usually includes a welcoming message, instructions on how to use the app, and a button to start or continue. It sets the tone and purpose of the project.
    
    **User Input Screen:** This template focuses on capturing user input, such as text fields or buttons that allow users to enter their name, select options, or answer questions. This input is often used to personalize the app experience.
    
    **Information Screen:** This template provides additional content or information to the user. It might contain instructions, educational facts, or the purpose of the app. This is often static text or images that provide context.
    
    **Feedback Screen:** This template is designed to give users feedback based on their input or actions within the app. It might display a "Thank You" message, show correct/incorrect answers in a quiz, or provide a summary of what the user has accomplished.
    
    **End/Exit Screen:** This template serves as the final screen of the app, often thanking the user for participating and providing options to restart the experience or exit the app.

## **Lesson Two - Plotting Shapes**

**Question of the Day:** How can we clearly communicate how to draw something on a screen?

To clearly communicate how to draw something on a screen, we need to use precise and simple instructions.
  
  -The Drawing Shapes templete:
  
      Explore using this tool that lets you draw different colored shapes.
         - Choose a color to change the color of the shapes
         - Click on a shape EVERY TIME you want to draw a new shape
## **Lesson Three - Shapes and Coordinates**

**Question of the Day:** How can we use coordinates to position and size shapes on a canvas?

To position and size shapes effectively on a screen, we must understand how coordinates and dimensions work in a 2D grid system.

- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Canvas and Grid:** The canvas has a coordinate system starting at `(0, 0)` in the top-left corner. The x-axis increases to the right, and the y-axis increases downward.
  - **Rect Function:** The `rect(x, y)` function places a rectangle on the canvas with its top-left corner at `(x, y)`. Additional parameters can be used for width and height.
  - **Predicting Placement:** Experimenting with different `(x, y)` values helps visualize where shapes will appear.
  - **Default Dimensions:** If width and height are not specified, default values (e.g., 50x50 pixels) are used.

- **Activities:**
  - Draw shapes on the grid using coordinates.
  - Test various values to understand their effect on shape position and size.
  - Discuss with peers to predict shape placement based on given code.
