# Game Title
# Maze Runner: Time Rush
## Objective
The goal of the game is to navigate a robot (player) through a series of increasingly challenging maze levels and reach the green goal square within a time limit. Players must avoid colliding with walls and complete all five levels to win.

## Game Features
### 1. Core Gameplay
Player Movement:

The player can move using the arrow keys.
The robot starts at a designated position in each level and needs to navigate to the goal.
Goal:

The green square represents the goal.
Reaching the goal advances the player to the next level.
Obstacles:

Walls block the playerâ€™s path.
Colliding with a wall resets the player's position and reduces one life.
### 2. Game Mechanics
Timer:

Each level has a 30-second countdown.
If the timer reaches 0, the game is over, and the player loses.
Lives:

The player starts with 3 lives.
Losing all lives results in a game over.
Levels:

The game consists of 5 levels, each with a unique layout of walls and a repositioned goal.
The difficulty increases as levels progress with more complex wall arrangements.
Win and Lose Conditions:

Winning:
Reaching the goal in the final level (Level 5) results in a victory.

Running out of time or lives ends the game.
