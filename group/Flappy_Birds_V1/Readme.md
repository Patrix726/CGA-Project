## Overview

**The Double Flappy Birds** is a modern version of the classic Flappy Bird game. It was developed using **p5.js**, an open-source JavaScript library designed for creative coding, along with sound integration to enhance gameplay experience. The game features a customizable bird selection, multiple menus (Main Menu, How to Play, Credits, and Pause Menu), and smooth game mechanics such as pipe generation, gravity simulation, and user inputs.

The game includes an easy-to-use interface with intuitive controls, making it suitable for users of all ages. It also incorporates background music and sound effects, adding to the immersive experience.

## Features

- **Main Menu**: Allows players to start the game, select a bird, view instructions on how to play, or view credits.
- **Character Selection**: Players can choose between different birds (e.g., "Flappy" or "New Flappy Bird").
- **How to Play**: Instructions on how to play the game, including the mechanics of making the bird flap and avoiding pipes.
- **Credits**: Information about the game development and music sources.
- **Gameplay**: Players control the bird using the spacebar to flap and must avoid obstacles (pipes). The goal is to survive as long as possible while earning points for each successfully avoided pipe.
- **Pause Feature**: The game can be paused anytime during gameplay by pressing the 'P' key.
- **Game Over and Restart**: When the bird collides with a pipe or reaches the bottom of the screen, the game ends, and the player can restart by pressing 'R'.
- **Responsive Sound**: Background music and sound effects for bird flap and collision are integrated.

## Game Mechanics

### Bird Movement

- The bird is affected by gravity, causing it to fall slowly unless the player presses the spacebar to make it flap.
- Flapping gives the bird an upward velocity, and gravity pulls it down.
- The bird has rotation behavior based on its velocity: it tilts upwards when moving upwards and tilts downwards when falling.

### Pipes

- Pipes are generated at regular intervals and move from right to left across the screen.
- The player needs to avoid colliding with pipes, both at the top and bottom.
- Every time the bird successfully avoids a pipe, the player earns a point.
  
### Collisions

- The bird collides with pipes if it intersects with any part of a pipe. This results in the game ending.
- The bird also collides with the ground or the ceiling of the screen, which results in a game over.

### Scoring

- The player earns points for each pipe successfully avoided.
- The score is displayed at the top of the screen.
